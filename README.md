# Pomodoro Clock

This is a timer that helps you stay focused. Named after the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), it allows you to set a timer to focus on a task. The default session time is 25 minutes, and the default break time is 5 minutes. Both can be changed by using the up and down arrows. There is also a reset button that resets the time to its default state.
